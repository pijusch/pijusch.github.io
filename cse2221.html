<!--   <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Attendance at lecture periods is highly encouraged, but not required.</li>
    <li>Attendance at lab periods is required.</li>
    <li>You will be allowed 4 lab absences without penalty; this
      includes both excused and unexcused absences (though exceptions
      may be made provided documentation on excused absences). Any lab
      absences over this limit will result in a 0.5-point deduction from
      your total score for each absence.</li>
    <li>In order to get credit for attendance in lab, you need to
      either 1) have your completed lab checked by a grader or me, or 2)
      be present and working for the majority of the period (45-50
      minutes).</li>
    <li>If you do not fully complete a lab activity during the lab
      period you should complete it on your own later.</li>
	<li>For closed labs that you miss, you may complete the lab on your
	own and demonstrate the finished work to me to have it not count towards
	your absence count.
  </ul> -->

  <h3>Collaboration and Cheating</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have not done so already, read the shared course
      policies here: <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/web/policies.html">http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/web/policies.html
    </a>
    </li>

    <li>You are permitted to discuss homeworks and closed labs with
      your peers. This does NOT extend to copying or sharing of answers.
      If you want to be prepared for the final exam, you need to
      practice solving problems and writing answers to them.</li>

    <li>You may NOT work with anyone else on the projects. If you
      need guidance, contact me or the graders via email or office hour
      visit, or ask on Piazza. If you ask a question about a project on
      Piazza, DO NOT POST ANY CODE; sharing code with other students is
      considered to be cheating. [Au'21 note, we may no longer be using Piazza
	  due to legal reasons. The no sharing source code rule applies for
	  any communication tool we might be using]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General Project Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Start early! Giving yourself only one day to work on a
      project is not enough time to complete it thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Check your submissions! After uploading a project onto
      Carmen, download it yourself and see if you turned in the correct
      files and that they compile and run correctly. Submissions for the
      wrong project and those that don't compile get a zero, this is
      easily avoided if you check your work.</li>
    <li>If you have not already done so, read the <a href="http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/software/web/policies.html">Software
        Sequence Course Policies page</a>. It provides a brief outline on
      how projects are graded.
    </li>
    <li>Generally speaking, we grade 2221 projects mainly on
      functionality (i.e. how many of our test cases does your code
      handle correctly) and slightly on style (fixing CheckStyle and
      FindBugs errors and making an attempt to comment your code).
  </li></ul>

    <b><p>Ask for help when you get stuck. The graders and I want you
      to succeed in this class and in your future studies, part of that
      is learning when and how to ask for help.</p></b>
